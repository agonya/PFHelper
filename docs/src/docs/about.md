# About

## How YOU can contribute to the project

PFHelper is readily hosted on github, in a private repository. Any number of collaborators can contact the creators to gain access to the repo. After that, changing/adding anything and creating pull requests is the way to go to further improve the project.

## Upcoming improvements to the helper

As you may have noticed, some functions do not have ts/jsdoc explanations before them, or some classes do not have their respected pages. This project has been brought to life as a side project, so some informations and documentations are still pending for development. We as the team would love it to have you onboard, and develop the helper further, together.

## What about file size?

The helper files, if all are imported, are roughly about 50 KB in size, including all comment blocks that serve as intellisense when typing out code. After webpack does its magic, we estimate this to be around 20-25 KB fully imported, so keep that in mind.
